When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-> I wanna use remote repositories when I'm working with other people on a project. I'd also like to
   use them when I want to share my code with someone, even if they just want to see my code and not 
   contribute to it. Sometimes I use them when I want to work from different computers and keep the 
   code up-to-date on all the computers. Also, remotes can be a good way to keep a backup of my work.
