When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-> I wanna use remote repositories when I'm working with other people on a project. I'd also like to
   use them when I want to share my code with someone, even if they just want to see my code and not 
   contribute to it. Sometimes I use them when I want to work from different computers and keep the 
   code up-to-date on all the computers. Also, remotes can be a good way to keep a backup of my work.
   
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-> I might wanna pull changes manually because that way, if I'm working on code, it doesn't change 
   without me expecting it. For example, if I know the new version of some code is broken, or I'm 
   experimenting a new feature, so I might not want to pull that change until I the bug is fixed.
